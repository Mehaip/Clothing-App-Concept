# Umbrella: Concept App for Weather-Based Streetwear Recommendations

## Overview
Umbrella is a conceptual web application designed to suggest streetwear recommendations based on real-time weather conditions. It is simply a personal project made with the purpose of learning and exploring various technologies and API integrations. It serves as an introduction to back-end and front-end development.

## Tech Stack
- **Flask**: Used for the back-end to handle requests and serve weather data.
- **JavaScript**: Fetches the weather info and adds it to the website. Also used to trigger certain events (e.g., when clicking 'start', an animation begins) + FadeIn, FadeOut, and sliding animations.
- **HTML**: Provides the structure for the user interface.
- **CSS**: Styles the application.

## API Usage
The app integrates:
- **Location API**: Retrieves the user's location based on their IP address.
- **Weather API**: Fetches current weather conditions for the given location.

### APIs Used
- **pyowm**: [pyowm Documentation](https://pypi.org/project/pyowm/)

- **Real-time Location**: [ipinfo.io](https://ipinfo.io/)


-Each time the page loads, it refreshes the weather info.
